    <h1>Network Security</h1>
    <p>Refers to cybersecurity which is cyberspace security at a national level. Its a measuree to prevent intrusion, attacks, 
        interference .......1940's - Communication security period.........1970's - Information security period......1990's - Information
        assuarance period........Today - Cybersecurity period
    </p>
    <h2>Communication Security Period</h2>
    <p>Information system security was limited to ensuring physical security of information and confidentiality</p>
    <h2>Information Security Period</h2>
    <p>Entered into practical and large-scale use stage and data transmision could be completed through computer networks
        . Its main objective was to ensure Integrity, Availabilty and Confidentiality. (IAC).

    <h2>Cyberspace Security Space</h2>

    <h1>Significance of Building Network Security</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Importance</li>
        <li>Compliance....comply with the policies</li>
        <li>Profitability</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Network Security Threats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hackers</li>
        <li>Vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Ransomware attacks</li>
        <li>Information breach</li>
        <li>DDoS attacks</li>
        <li>Supply chain threats and attacks</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Network Security Situational Awareness</h1>
    <p>HiSec Insight is deployed on enterprise network to connect basic network data such as traffic and device logs using the flow prob</p>
     <h1>Zero Trust Security</h1>
     <p>Its a set of evolving network security paradigms that shift network defense from static network bounderies to users</p>
     <h1>Significance of Unfrmation Security Standards</h1>
     <p>They are</p>
