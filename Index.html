    <h1>Networking Security Concepts and Specificaions</h1>
    <h4>Forensics</h4>
    <p>Its the application of law and science. There are mobile forensics, malware analysis, windows forensics.</p>
    <h3>Challenges of Digital Forensics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Big Data</li>
        <li>Jurisdiction</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <p>Network Security Standards provdes guidlines and supervision for network security management</p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe Network Security</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Network Security</h1>
    <p>Refers to cybersecurity which is cyberspace security at a national level. Its a measuree to prevent intrusion, attacks, 
        interference .......1940's - Communication security period.........1970's - Information security period......1990's - Information
        assuarance period........Today - Cybersecurity period
    </p>
    <h2>Communication Security Period</h2>
    <p>Information system security was limited to ensuring physical security of information and confidentiality</p>
    <h2>Information Security Period</h2>
    <p>Entered into practical and large-scale use stage and data transmision could be completed through computer networks
        . Its main objective was to ensure Integrity, Availabilty and Confidentiality. (IAC).
    </p>
    <h2>Cyberspace Security Space</h2>

    <h1>Significance of Building Network Security</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Importance</li>
        <li>Compliance....comply with the policies</li>
        <li>Profitability</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Network Security Threats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hackers</li>
        <li>Vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Ransomware attacks</li>
        <li>Information breach</li>
        <li>DDoS attacks</li>
        <li>Supply chain threats and attacks</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Network Security Situational Awareness</h1>
    <p>HiSec Insight is deployed on enterprise network to connect basic network data such as traffic and device logs using the flow prob</p>
     <h1>Zero Trust Security</h1>
     <p>Its a set of evolving network security paradigms that shift network defense from static network bounderies to users</p>
     <h1>Significance of Unfrmation Security Standards</h1>
     <p>They are</p>
     <p>International Organization include</p>
     <h1>Common Information Security Standards and Specfications</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>Cybersecurity Classified Protection System .......protects information and information carriers</li>
        <li>ISO 27001....is the international standard for an information security management system</li>
        <li>TCSEC....Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria is proposed by the Defense Science Board</li>
        <li>ITSE....Information Technology SEC...flexibility</li>
     </ul>
     <h1>Project Implementation Methodology Procedure</h1>
     <h1>Definition of Cybersecurity Classified Protection</h1>
     <p>Protects information and information carriers based on their importance levels</p>
     <h1>Significance of Cybersecurity Classified Protection</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>Legal and regulatory complience</li>
        <li>Security systemization</li>
        <li>Security Awareness improvement</li>
        <li>Service Security Requirements</li>
     </ul>
     <h1>IP Data Encyption and Authentication</h1>
     <p>IPsec provides two security mechanisms ..that is encryption and authentication</p>
     <h1>IKE...Internet Key Exchange</h1>

     <br>
     <br>
     <h1>Firewall </h1>
     <h2>Background of Hot Standby Technologies</h2>
     <p>All packets exchange between intranet and internet users pass through firewall</p>
     <h2>Virtual Router Redudancy Protocol</h2>
     <h2>VRRP-based Router Redudancy Deployment</h2>
     <p>Here we have a backup router that can replace a faulty master router</p>
     <h2>VRRP Application in Multi-Zone Firewall Networking</h2>
     <p>When the hot standby is required for firewalls in multiple zones, you need to configure multiple VRRP groups</p>
     <h2>Defects of VRRP</h2>
     <p>Traditinal VRRP cannot ensure the state of information consistency and VRRP status consistency</p>
     <h2>VGMP Basic Principles</h2>
     <p>Virtual Group Management Protocol 1.....It manages the status of all VRRP groups in a unified manner to ensure the consistent VRRP 
        groups status
     </p>
     <h1>VGMP Group Management</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>Status consistency Management.....controls the status switchover of all VRRP groups in an unified manner</li>
        <li>Preemption Management...when the active device recovers, the priority of its VGMP group is also restored</li>
        <li>Channel Management.....determines available interfaces between two firewalls</li>
     </ul>
